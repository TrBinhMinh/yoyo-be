# yoyo-be

**yoyo-be** is a NestJS application with a MongoDB database. It provides API endpoints to manage user-submitted posts, including retrieving, approving, and rejecting posts.

## Features

- **Retrieve Posts**: Get all user-submitted posts.
- **Approve/Reject Posts**: Endpoints for moderators to approve or reject posts.

## Project Structure

The app is structured into the following key features:
- **Feed Resource**: Handles API requests for posts and connects with MongoDB for storage and retrieval.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores posts and their approval status.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented for managing the feed (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Approach

### 1. Requirement Breakdown

The first step involved reading and understanding the project requirements. I then broke them down into smaller tasks to simplify the development process.

### 2. Project Initialization

I initialized the project using NestJS and set up the necessary environment and configuration files. Next, I installed all required packages, including:
- NestJS modules (for API management)
- Mongoose (for MongoDB integration)

### 3. Resource Generation

I generated a resource for the "Feed" feature using NestJS's CLI, which provided the scaffolding for the controller, service, and module. These handle the logic for retrieving, approving, and rejecting posts.

### 4. MongoDB Connection

I connected the app to a MongoDB instance using the Mongoose package, which allows for interaction with the database. This enabled full CRUD operations for the feed.

### 5. CRUD Implementation

Finally, I implemented the CRUD operations for managing the feed:
- **Create**: New posts can be submitted.
- **Read**: Posts can be retrieved.
- **Update**: Posts can be approved or rejected.
- **Delete**: Posts can be deleted if necessary.
